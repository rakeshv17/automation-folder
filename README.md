# Automation Folder

This repository is a collection of automation Proof-of-Concepts (POCs), each organized in its own subfolder. The goal is to provide a central source of code for various automation solutions, making it easy to showcase, reuse, and extend automation projects.

## Structure
Each automation POC is placed in a separate folder under the root of the repository. For example:

```
automation-folder/
├── step_function/         # AWS Step Function automation (see its README for details)
├── another_automation/   # Placeholder for future automation POCs
├── ...                   # Add more as you build new automations
```

## How to Use
- Browse each folder for a specific automation use case.
- Each folder contains its own README.md with detailed instructions, features, and setup steps.
- All code is organized for clarity and easy reuse.

## Current Automations
- **step_function/**: AWS Step Function automation with Lambda retrigger and Webex notification. [See details here.](./step_function/README.md)

## Contributing
- Add new automation POCs as new folders.
- Include a README.md in each new folder describing the automation, setup, and usage.
- Follow best practices for code organization and documentation.

## License
This repository is open source and available under the MIT License.

> This repo is intended as a showcase and source of reusable automation code for personal and professional use. Each folder is self-contained and can be demonstrated independently.
