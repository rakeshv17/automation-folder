# AWS Glue Cost Analysis Automation

This automation provides a deep-dive analysis of AWS Glue service costs for the last two months, detects cost spikes, and generates actionable insights using a local LLM (Ollama + mistral). Results are automatically sent to a Webex Teams channel for team review and action.

## Features
- Downloads daily AWS Glue cost data (by region) for the last two months using AWS Cost Explorer.
- Analyzes daily costs, detects spikes, and summarizes top regions.
- Uses a local LLM (Ollama + mistral) to generate human-readable observations and recommendations.
- Sends concise cost reports and LLM-generated insights to a Webex Teams channel using a bot.
- All analysis is performed locally on downloaded dataâ€”no changes are made to your AWS account.

## Setup & Usage

### 1. Download Glue Cost Data
Run this command to get the last two months of Glue costs by region:
```sh
aws ce get-cost-and-usage \
  --time-period Start=2025-07-01,End=2025-09-01 \
  --granularity DAILY \
  --metrics "UnblendedCost" \
  --filter '{"Dimensions":{"Key":"SERVICE","Values":["AWS Glue"]}}' \
  --group-by Type="DIMENSION",Key="REGION" \
  --profile <your-aws-profile> > glue_last_two_months.json
```

### 2. Set Up Webex Bot Credentials
- Create a Webex bot and get its access token.
- Get your Webex Teams room (channel) ID.
- Export these as environment variables:
  ```sh
  export WEBEX_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
  export WEBEX_ROOM_ID=your_room_id
  ```

### 3. Run Ollama Locally
- Install Ollama (https://ollama.com/download) and pull a model (e.g., mistral):
  ```sh
  ollama pull mistral
  ollama run mistral
  ```

### 4. Run the Analysis Script
- Use the provided `glue_analysis.py` script:
  ```sh
  python3 glue_analysis.py
  ```
- The script will:
  - Analyze Glue costs and spikes
  - Use LLM for observations
  - Send concise results to your Webex channel

## What Happens
- The script analyzes AWS Glue costs for spikes and trends.
- It uses a local LLM (Ollama + mistral) for deep-dive, human-readable analysis.
- Both the summary and LLM output are sent to your Webex Teams channel for team review and action.
- No changes are made to your AWS account; all analysis is performed on downloaded data.

## Requirements
- Python 3, requests library
- AWS CLI configured
- Ollama installed and running with a model (e.g., mistral)
- Webex bot and room credentials

## Files
- `glue_analysis.py`: Main analysis and reporting script.
- `glue_last_two_months.json`: Downloaded AWS Glue cost data (not included in repo).

## Notes
- The script automatically truncates messages to fit Webex Teams limits.
- You can customize the LLM prompt or summary logic as needed for your team.

This automation is intended for cost transparency, anomaly detection, and collaborative cost optimization for AWS Glue usage.
